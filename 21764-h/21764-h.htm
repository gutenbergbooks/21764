<h2 class="space">FOREWORD.</h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>In writing these stories, no attempt has
been made to follow the plot or problem
of the poems, which in almost every case
lies beyond the child's reach. The simple
purpose as found in the whole, or the suggestion
of only a stanza or scene, has been
used as opportunity for picturing and reflecting
something of the poetry and intention
of the originals.</p>

<p>As story-teller to the same circle of
children for several years, it became necessary
to draw upon the great literary fount for
suggestion, and it was found that "Pippa,"
the art child of industry, could add a poetic
impulse toward the handwork of spinning,
thread-winding, weaving, the making of spinning
wheels, winders, and looms, without too
great violence to the original poem itself.</p>

<p>"Mignon," as the creature of an art that
exists for art's sake, was set to contrast with
Pippa, who through service finds a song to
heal and to inspire.</p>

<p>"Siegfried" and "Parsifal," as knight
stories, were given with their musical <i>motifs</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>The writer hopes for "Child Stories"
that it may serve to suggest to teachers
how they may utilize the great store of
poetry and art at hand. To do this they
are themselves under the joyful necessity of
keeping close to the great sources. On this
last point Mr. Wm. T. Harris says: "A
view of the world is a perpetual stimulant
to thought, always prompting one to reflect
on the immediate fact or event before him,
and to discover its relation to the ultimate
principle of the universe. It is the only
antidote for the constant tendency of the
teacher to sink into a dead formalism, the
effect of too much iteration and of the practice
of adjusting knowledge to the needs of
the feeble-minded by perpetual explanation
of what is already simple <i>ad nauseam</i> for
the mature intelligence of the teacher. It
produces a sort of pedagogical cramp in the
soul, for which there is no remedy like a
philosophical view of the world, unless, perhaps,
it be the study of the greatest poets,
Shakespere, Dante, and Homer."</p>

<h2 class="space">PIPPA.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span></p>

<p>All the year in the little village of
Asola the great wheels of the mills
went round and round. It seemed to the very
little children that they never, never stopped,
but went on turning and singing, turning and
singing. No matter where you went in the
village, the hum of the wheels could always
be heard; and though no one could really say
what the wheels sang, everyone turned gladly
to his work or went swiftly on his errand
when he heard the busy song.</p>

<p>Everyone was proud of the mills in Asola,
and the children most of all. The very little
ones would go to the lowest windows and
look into the great dim room where the
wheels were, and they wondered, as they
looked, if ever they would grow wise enough
to help make silk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>Those children who were older wound
thread on the bobbins, or helped at the looms.
And whenever they saw the bright stuff in
shop windows, or a beautiful woman passed in
silken robes, they looked with shining eyes.
"See how beautiful!" they would say. "We
helped. She needs us; the world needs us!"
and their hearts were so full of gladness at
the thought.</p>

<p>The poet tells us there was a child there
whose name was Pippa, and she worked all
day in this mill, winding silk on the little
whirling, whirling spools.</p>

<p>Now in the year there was one day they
gave her for her own&mdash;one perfect day when
she could walk in the sweet, sweet meadows,
or wander toward the far, strange hills. And
this one precious day was so shining and full
of joy to Pippa that its light shone all about
her until the next, making itself into dreams
and little songs that she sang to her whirring
spools.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>One night, when the blessed time would
be next morning, she said to the day:</p>

<p>"Sweet Day, I am Pippa, and have only
you for the joy of my whole long year; come
to me gentle and shining, and I will do whatever
loving deed you bring me."</p>

<p>And the blessed day broke golden and
perfect!</p>

<p>She sprang up singing; she sang to the
sunbeams, and to her lily, and to the joy in
the world; she ran out, and leaped as she
went; the grass blew in the wind, and the long
yellow road rolled away like unwound silk.</p>

<p>She sang on and on, hardly knowing.
And it was a sweet song no one had ever
heard. It was what birds sing, only this had
words; and this song was so full of joy that
when a sad poet heard it he stopped the lonely
tune he piped, and listened till his heart
thrilled. And when he could no longer hear,
he took up the sweet strain and played it so
strong and clear that it set the whole air<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
a-singing. The children in the street began
dancing and laughing as he played; the old
looked up; a lame man felt that he might
leap, and the blind who begged at corners forgot
they did not see, the song was so full of
the morning wonder.</p>

<p>But little Pippa did not know this; she
had passed on singing.</p>

<p>Out beyond the village there were men
who worked, building a lordly castle. And
there was a youth among them who was a
stair-builder, and he had a deep sorrow. The
dream of the perfect and beautiful work was
in his life, but it was given to him to build
only the stairs men trod on. And as he knelt
working wearily at his task, from somewhere
beyond the thicket there came a strange,
sweet song, and these were the words:</p>

<p class="center">All service ranks the same with God:<br />
... there is no last nor first."</p>

<p>The youth sprang up; the wind lifted his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
hair, the light leaped into his eyes, and he began
to do the smallest thing perfectly.</p>

<p>Farther down the road there was a ruined
house; a man leaned his head on his
hand and looked from the window. A great
deed that the world needed must be done;
and the man loved the great deed, but his
heart had grown faint, and he waited.</p>

<p>And it chanced that Pippa passed, singing,
and her song reached the man; and it
was to him as if God called. He rose up
strong and brave, and leaping to his horse he
rode away to give the great deed to the world.</p>

<p>At night when the tired Pippa lay upon
her little bed, she said to the day, "Sweet
Day, you brought me no loving deed to give
in payment for the joy you gave."</p>

<p>But the day knew.</p>

<p>And on the morrow, the child Pippa went
back to the mill and wound the silk bobbins,
and she was so full of gladness, she hummed
with them all day.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p><br />

<p>Once there was a band of people who
did nothing but wander about from
village to village, giving shows in the marketplaces.
They had no homes or gardens or
fields, but the fathers earned the living by
doing remarkable things.</p>

<p>The little children played in the wagons,
and the mothers cooked the meals over the
camp-fire when they stopped outside the village,
and they were quite happy after their
own fashion. But often, when they passed
down the streets between the rows of thatched
houses with children playing in the yards, it
all seemed to them something very beautiful
indeed, and they looked at it as long as it was
possible.</p>

<p>The little girl of the strong man, and the
little boy whose father walked on his hands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
often stood a long, long time looking through
the fence at children who had real hollyhocks
in their yards, besides a little green
tree growing right out of the thatch on the
top of the roof; and in some of the houses,
where the doors stood open, they could see
the most shining pans and kettles ranged
about the chimney.</p>

<p>But whenever they made a beautiful playhouse,
with all the leaves brushed away and
the rooms marked out with little sticks, they
had to leave it next day. This was very discouraging,
of course. Even the fathers and
mothers grew discouraged sometimes, when
they rode through the beautiful country. It
was so sweet and so fair, and somehow it
really seemed calling to them in a loving
voice. But they always went on and on, from
place to place, and no one ever knew what
the real message was. But sometimes, deep
in the strong man's heart there grew the
strangest longing to go into the fields and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
reap and bind with the reapers, so that he too
might see the yellow sheaves standing together
when work was over.</p>

<p>In this circus, where he lifted the heaviest
weights, and held the little boy and his own
little girl straight out with his hands quite a
long time, it was very wonderful indeed. But
there was never anything after, to show it had
been done, except a great deal of clapping
and calling from the people. And this was
partly for the children, who had such round,
pleasant faces, and ran away just as soon as
the father put them down. The strong man
was always thinking of this when he walked
beside the wagon and looked off over the
fields where the men were working. And it
was so with all of them; but as no one spoke
of it they were thought to be a very gay company,
for they laughed quite often. And after
all, it did seem to them a very grand thing
when they entered the village. The people
ran to the doors and windows, and streamed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
out of the inn; and the children ran after the
wagon, looking at them with the greatest
wonder.</p>

<p>Whatever sadness they may have felt
about their life, they forgot it entirely when
they stood before the people in their spangled
suits. Then it seemed to them quite the
greatest thing to make a whole village stare.
They walked about very proudly, and talked
in very deep tones. Sometimes they allowed
one or two of the largest boys to help make
ready for the show. In one of the villages,
the shoemaker's lame Charlie had helped lay
the carpet on which the strong man stood
when he did his part.</p>

<p>Among these people who went about
there was a child. Her name was Mignon;
and when the tumblers had leaped over the
high rods and stood upon each other's shoulders
for the last time, and the strong man had
bowed and gone away amid the greatest applause,
this Mignon danced for the people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
When it was very still, and the strange, beautiful
music had sounded, she would come
slowly forward, and placing her hands on her
breast she would bow very low, and begin to
stir and sway in time. How beautiful it was!
It was like a flower in the wind, and all the
people stood still and looked with wonder.</p>

<p>Sometimes she sang; it was the strangest
song that ever was sung by a child. It was
always about far-off lands, where it seemed to
her the real joy was. Tears shone in the eyes
of all the people as they listened, and when it
was over and they were again at their work,
a deep sadness seemed in everything. They
too had begun to think that the real joy might
be a long, long way off from them.</p>

<p>And Mignon went on from village to village,
singing and dancing and seeking. Always
she was thinking, "Who knows but tomorrow,
in the next village or the next, I will
find the real joy? it will come to me as I sing
or stir with the beautiful music!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>But, children, Mignon never found it.</p>

<p>The feet that were meant to fly on loving
errands only danced, and though it was so
beautiful it was really nothing, and the real
joy was not in it.</p>

<p>Do you not know that every little child
that comes into the world has a blessed deed
in its life? But with Mignon it only lay heavy
on her heart, and she was more weary than
any child who serves all day. And after
awhile this weariness grew as deep as her life,
and the poet tells us that she died. We read
in his strange book that they bore her to the
dim hall of the Past, and that she lay there
white and beautiful. Four boys clothed in
blue with silver stood beside her, slowly waving
white plumes. And when the people had
come in and stood together very silently, the
most beautiful singing voices began&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Whom bring ye us to the still dwelling?'"</p>

<p>The four boys answered:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>"'Tis a tired playmate whom we bring
you. Let her rest in your still dwelling. Let
us weep. Let us remain with her!'"</p>

<p>But the sweet voices rang out,</p>

<p>"'Children, turn back into life! Your tears
let the fresh air dry. Haste back into life!
Let the day give you <i>labor</i> and <i>joy</i>, till evening
bring you rest.'"</p>

<p>And the listening children understood.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space">THE STORY OF SIEGFRIED.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span></p>

<p>Long, long ago, before the sun learned to
shine so brightly, people believed very
strange things. Why, even the wisest thought
storm clouds were war-maidens riding, and
that a wonderful shining youth brought the
springtime; and whenever sunlight streamed
into the water they said to one another, "See,
it is some of the shining gold, some of the
magic Rhine-gold. Ah, if we should find the
Rhine-gold we would be masters of the world&mdash;the
whole world;" and they would stretch
out their arms and look away on every side.
Even little children began looking for the
hidden gold as they played, and they say that
Odin, a god who lived in the very deepest
blue of the sky, came down and lay in the
grass to watch the place where he thought it
was.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>Now this gold was hidden in the very
deepest rocky gorge, and a dragon that everyone
feared lay upon it night and day. Almost
all the people in the world were wanting and
seeking this gold; it really seemed sometimes
that they were forgetting everything else,
even the sweet message and the deed they
had brought the world. Some of them went
about dreaming and thinking of all the ways
there were of finding it. But they seldom did
anything of all they thought, so they were
called the Mist-men. And there were others,
who worked always, digging in the darkest
caverns of the mountains, and lived underground
and almost forgot the real light, watching
for the glow of the gold. These were
called the Earth-dwarfs, for they grew very
small and black living away from the light.
But there were a great many blessed ones who
lived quite free and glad in the world, loving
and serving one another and not thinking very
much of the gold.</p>

<p>T<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>here was a boy whose name was Siegfried,
and though he lived with an Earth-dwarf
in the deep forest, he knew nothing of the
magic gold or the world. He had never seen
a man, and he had not known his mother,
even, though he often thought of her when
he stood still at evening and the birds came
home. There was one thing she had left him,
and that was a broken sword. Mimi, the Earth-dwarf,
strove night and day to mend it, thinking
he might slay the dragon. But though he
worked always, it was never done, for no one
who feared anything in the world could weld
it, because it was an immortal blade. It had
a name and a soul.</p>

<p>Each evening when Siegfried thought of
his sword he would come bounding down the
mountains, blowing great horn-blasts. One
night he came laughing and shouting, and
leaped into the cave, driving a bear he had
bridled, straight on the poor frightened Mimi.
He ran round and round, and darted here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
and there, until Siegfried could go no more
for laughing, and the bear broke from the
rope and ran into the woods. When Siegfried
turned he saw that the poor little dwarf
was crouched trembling behind the anvil, and
he stopped laughing, and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Why do you shake and cry and run?" he
asked. The dwarf said nothing, but the fire
began to glow strangely, and the sword shone.</p>

<p>"Do you not know what fear is?" cried
the dwarf at last.</p>

<p>"No," said the boy, and he went over and
took up the sword; and lo! the blade fell
apart in his hand. They stood still and looked
at each other. "Can a man fear and make
swords?" asked the boy. The dwarf said
nothing, but the forge fire flashed and sparkled,
and the broken sword gleamed, in the
strangest way.</p>

<p>The boy smiled, and gathering up the
pieces he ground them to fine powder; and
when he had done, he placed the precious dust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
in the forge and pulled at the great bellows,
so that the fire glowed into such a shining that
the whole cave was light.</p>

<p>But the dwarf grew blacker and smaller
as he watched the boy. When he saw him
pour the melted steel in the mold and lay it
on the fire, and heard him singing at his work,
he began to rage and cry; but Siegfried only
laughed and went on singing. When he took
out the bar and struck it into the water there
was a great hissing, and the Mist-men stood
there with Mimi, and they raged and cried
together. But still Siegfried only laughed and
sang as he pulled at his bellows or swung his
hammers. At every blow he grew stronger
and greater, and the sword bent and quivered
like a living flame, until at last, with a joyful
cry, he lifted it above his head with both his
hands; it fell with a great blow, and behold!
the anvil was severed, and lay apart before
him.</p>

<p>The joy in Siegfried's heart grew into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
most wonderful peace, and the forge light
seemed to grow into full day. The immortal
sword was again in the world. But Mimi and
the Mist-men were gone.</p>

<p>And the musician shows in wonderful music-pictures
how Siegfried went out into the
early morning, and how the light glittered on
the trembling leaves and sifted through in little
splashes. He stood still, listening to the stir
of the leaves and the hum of the bees and the
chirp of the birds. Two birds were singing as
they built a nest, and he wondered what they
said to one another. He cut a reed and tried
to mock their words, but it was like nothing.
He began to wish that he might speak to some
one like himself, and he wondered about his
mother; why had she left him? It seemed to
him he was the one lone thing in the world.
He lifted his silver horn and blew a sweet
blast, but no friend came. He blew again and
again, louder and clearer, until suddenly the
leaves stirred to a great rustling; and the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
earth seemed to tremble. He looked, and behold!
he had waked the dragon that all men
feared; and it was coming toward him, breathing
fire and smoke. But Siegfried did not
know what fear was; he only laughed and
leaped over it, as he plunged; and when it
reared to spring upon him, he drove the immortal
blade straight into its heart.</p>

<p>Now when Siegfried plucked out his sword
he smeared his finger with the blood, and it
burned like fire, so that he put it in his mouth
to ease the pain. Then suddenly the most
strange thing happened: he understood all
the hum and murmur of the woods; and lo!
the bird on the very branch above was singing
of his mother and of him, and of the gold that
was his if he would give up his sword and
would love and serve none in the world. And
more, she sang on of one who slept upon a
lonely mountain: a wall of fire burned around,
that none could pass but he who knew no fear.</p>

<p>Siegfried listened to hear more, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
bird fluttered away before him. He saw it
going, and he forgot the gold and the whole
world, and followed it. It led him on and on,
to a lonely mountain, where he saw light
burning; and he climbed up and up, and always
the light grew brighter. But when he
was nearly at the top, and would have bounded
on, he could not, for Odin stood there with
his spear across the way. The fire glowed
and flashed around them, but the sword
gleamed brighter than anything that ever
shone, as Siegfried cleft the mighty spear and
leaped into the flame. And there at last, in
the great shining, this Siegfried beheld a mortal
like himself. He stood still in wonder.
He saw the light glinting on armor, and he
thought, "I have found a knight, a friend!"
And he went over and took the helmet from
the head. Long ruddy hair, like flame, fell
down. Then he raised the shield, and behold!
in white glistening robes he saw the maid
Brunhilde. And she was so beautiful! The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
light glowed into a great shining as he looked,
and, hardly knowing, he leaned and kissed
her, and she awoke.</p>

<p>And it seemed to Siegfried that he had
found his mother and the whole world.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<hr class="short" />

<h2 class="space">A FISH AND A BUTTERFLY.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span></p>

<p>At the very farthest end of the meadow
there is water, blue with sky. It flows
on and on, growing broad and strong farther
down, to turn the mill wheel. But here in the
meadow, you can see far off on the other
side, and hear the cows ripping off the tender
grass, and smell the perfume of wild plums.</p>

<p>Boy Blue lay in the long cool grass watching
the water. How sleepily it moved, and
what a pretty song it sang! How clear! he
could count the pebbles at the bottom; and
there, swimming straight toward him, came a
tiny fish, making little darts from one side to
another, and snapping at the tadpoles on the
way. Then he stopped just in front of him.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said a voice; and the little
boy could not tell whether it was the fish, or
the tomtit scolding on the elder bush. "Dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
me!" came the voice again; and the little fish
sighed, making a bubble on the top of the
water, and rings that grew and grew till they
reached the other bank.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Boy Blue.</p>

<p>"I'd like a new play and new playmates,"
sighed the fish. "I'm so tired of the old
ones!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the boy, and was just about to
ask, "Would I do?" when there came floating
along in the air a beautiful butterfly, floating,
floating like a ship in full sail.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the fish, "how beautiful! how
beautiful! Come let us play together&mdash;let us
play."</p>

<p>The butterfly rested on a thistle bloom
and stirred her pale wings thoughtfully.
"Play?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, let us play. How beautiful thou art!"</p>

<p>"And thou!" said the butterfly; "all the
shine of the sun and sea gleams in thy armor.
Let us play together."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>"Let us play."</p>

<p>"Come then," said the butterfly; "come
up into the fresh morning air and the sunlight,
where everything smiles this sweet May day."</p>

<p>"There?" cried the fish; "I would die
there; I would die! There is no life for me
in your sunshine world. But come with me
into this glittering stream; here swimming
against the swift current is strong life. Come,
let us play here."</p>

<p>But the butterfly trembled. "There?" she
cried; "if I touched one single little wave I
should be swept out and away forever. There
is no life for me in the glittering stream."</p>

<p>They looked across at each other.</p>

<p>"But see," said the butterfly, "I will come
as near as I dare to your water world;" and
she spread her beautiful wings and floated
down to the edge of the water. The fish with
a great stroke swam toward her. But they
could only touch the same bit of earth, and
the waves always bore him back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>"Ah," he cried at last, "it is useless! we
cannot play together."</p>

<p>"Ah," wept the butterfly, "we cannot play
together."</p>

<p>"Boy Blue," said the farmer, brushing
aside the long grass, "you were asleep."</p>

<p>"Asleep!" said the little boy, jumping up;
"I couldn't have been. I heard every word
the fish and the butterfly said."<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space">HOW MARGARET LED FAUST THROUGH<br />
THE PERFECT WORLD.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span></p>

<p>There was once a very great man who
understood all of the most mysterious
things in the world. He knew quite perfectly
how spiders spun and how the firefly
kept his lantern burning. All of these marvelous
things were plain to him, for he had
read everything that had been written in
books, and he had spent his whole life searching
and peering through a strange glass at the
most wonderful small things. Always and
always he was thinking in his heart, "When
I know <i>everything</i> then I shall be content,
surely!"</p>

<p>So he went on searching and looking and
reading, night and day, in his dim room. Always
he was growing older and wearier, but
he did not think of that; he only knew that
the strange longing was growing in his heart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
and that he was never any happier than before.
But he would say to himself, "It is because
there is something I have not learned.
When I know everything, then surely the joy
will come to me."</p>

<p>One night he shut his book and laid aside
the strange glass, and sat quite still in the dim
room. He had found that there was nothing
more to be learned; there was nothing of all
the mysteries that he did not know perfectly.</p>

<p>And behold, the longing was still in his
heart, and no gladness came. He only felt
how weary and old he was. He thought:
"There <i>is</i> no joy in the world; there is nothing
good and perfect in the whole world!"
He closed his tired eyes and leaned his head
back. The lamp burned low, and the place
was very still for a long time. And then there
suddenly broke the most beautiful music right
under his window; children were singing, and
men and women, and above it all bells were
ringing&mdash;wonderful, joyous bells.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>"Can it be," said the old man&mdash;"can it
be that anyone is really joyful in the world?"
He rose up and went to the window, and
thrust back the great curtain.</p>

<p>And lo! it was morning!</p>

<p>The most beautiful, shining morning; people
were pouring out of all the houses, smiling
and singing, and bowing to one another; little
children were going together with flowers in
their hands, singing, and answering the tones
of the great bells; and one little child, as it
passed, looked right up at the great Doctor
Faust, and held out its white lily. The bells
chimed, and the singing grew sweeter and
clearer.</p>

<p>"If there is something joyful in the world,
surely some one will tell me," said the man;
and he went out into the morning.</p>

<p>It had rained in the night; there were
pools in the street, and the leaves glistened.
"How bright the light is!" he thought, and
"how strange the flowers look blooming in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
the sun!" But the birds flew away when he
came, and this made the strange longing in
the lonely man's heart grow into pain. So he
stepped back in the shadow and looked into
all the happy faces as they passed, and listened
to the singing.</p>

<p>But no one stopped to tell him anything.
They were so full of joy that they did not feel
his touch, and his words when he spoke were
swept right up into the song and the pealing
of the joy-bells.</p>

<p>Girls in white veils, with stalks of the
most beautiful lilies in their hands, passed him
in a long line, and the boys came after, in new
clothes, and shoes that squeaked. But he
only saw their shining, upturned faces. They
were so beautiful as they sang, that tears
stood in the smiling eyes of all the fathers and
mothers and neighbors who followed after.
Little children holding each other's hands
went together, and one little one had a queer
woolly lamb on wheels trundling behind him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>"Can it be," said the old man, "that there
is a deep joy in the world? will no one tell
me?" And he turned and went with the people;
and after awhile he met a young girl.</p>

<p>She was not singing, but the most beautiful
light shone from her face; so he knew she
was thinking of the deep joy, and he asked
her what it was, and why the people were
glad.</p>

<p>She looked at him with loving wonder,
and then she told him it was Easter morning,
when everything in the wide world remembers
fully that the joy can never die. "It is here
always," she told him.</p>

<p>"Always?" said the old man; and he shook
his head sadly.</p>

<p>"Always," she said; and she took his
hand and led him out of the throng into the
most beautiful ways. He did not know that
in the whole world there were such wonderful
grassy lanes. Why, there were hedges with
star-flowers here and there; apple trees were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
blooming, and between the cottages there were
gardens where seed had sprung up in rows.</p>

<p>In some of the houses people were going
about their homely tasks, and they were singing
softly, or saying the most gentle words to
one another as they worked. And before a
very humble door, where only one tall lily
bloomed, there sat a beautiful mother with a
baby on her knee and a little one beside her;
and they were looking straight into her eyes,
listening to the wonderful story of the Easter
morning. The father stopped to listen too,
and in every single face shone the same holy
light.</p>

<p>It shone even in the face of the Faust as
he passed.</p>

<p>And behold, when Margaret looked at
him he had grown young. His hair glinted
in the sun and the wonder had come back to
his eyes. Butterflies circled above them, and
they went on and on, free and glad together,
and the holy light was over everything.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>But the poet tells us that afterwards Faust
traveled into a very strange, far world, where
there was never any silence or living flowers.
Nothing was perfect or holy there, and Margaret
could not go. But they tell us that
whenever he looked away from this strange
world, he heard again the singing, and smelled
the faint fragrance of lilies, and it seemed to
him that he was there again in the light, with
the blessed Margaret leading him on forever.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<p>Dear children, there is a great story of
Heaven told by a poet called Dante,
who dreamed that he was led through Heaven
by the beautiful Beatrice.</p>

<p>And this is how it was. Dante had come
to think so many unloving thoughts of all the
people, that whenever he went about the
streets of Florence where he lived, he thought
he saw evil marks on all the faces. And it
seemed to him that everyone in the world was
lost from God. And the angry sorrow in his
heart grew so great that there was not a single
loving, hopeful thought in it. Then there
came to him a wonderful vision. It seemed
to him that Beatrice, whom he loved, came
down from God and spoke to him and led
him up, and showed him Heaven.</p>

<p>But his eyes were so dim at first, it seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
only the shining of a few small stars. But as
they journeyed, Beatrice spoke to him of many
things he had not understood, and while she
talked, Heaven grew plainer and he saw that
the stars were all shining together in a soft
radiance, like the halos of many saints. And
the wisdom of the world began to slip from
Dante, and he stood there in Heaven as a little
child.</p>

<p>Beatrice led him on and on, and whenever
she wished him to see Heaven more plainly
she talked of the world he lived in and the
men he hated. Now when one who lives with
God speaks of hate, it is nothing. And as he
listened, Dante began to see that Man was in
Heaven. When he had learned this, they
went with a great flight up to God. And behold!
it seemed to Dante that the higher he
went in Heaven the nearer home he came, for
all around him there were faces that he knew.</p>

<p>And they went on and on to the very
highest Heaven, where God and man live to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>gether,
and the angels cannot tell God from
man or man from God. And Beatrice showed
Dante this great mystery. And he stood still,
looking, with the great light shining into his
eyes.</p>

<p>Although he does not tell us what he saw,
we know it was Florence, where he lived, and
that he was looking at all the people with loving
eyes, and seeing them just as those who
live with God see men.</p>

<p>Heaven is here, little children. Let us
love one another.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span></p>

<p>Long, long ago, when the old nations were
child-nations, they had the most wonderful
dreams and stories in their hearts; and
they told them over so many, many times, with
love and wonder, that they grew into Art,&mdash;poems
and songs and pictures. And there is
one beautiful story which you will find in
many songs and poems, for almost every nation
has told it in its own way. And this is it:</p>

<p>Long, long ago&mdash;so long that no one can
tell whether it really happened or whether
the old German folk only dreamed it&mdash;there
was a band of knights who went away and
lived together on a beautiful high mountain,
far above the world, where no evil might ever
come to them; and there they thought of
nothing but pure and holy things. The purest
knight was chosen king among them, and
led them in all high things; and they lived so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
for many years, keeping themselves from
wrong and beholding blessed wonders that the
world had never seen,&mdash;miracles of light that
sometimes passed above them.</p>

<p>But once there came an evil thought to
the very king; nothing could put it away, and
it was like a spear-wound in his side that
nothing could heal. It was the greatest suffering;
it even touched the joy of the knights,
for they began to think only of what would
heal the king. Many went far and wide, seeking
a cure, while others dropped back to the
world again; for the pattern of purity was not
perfect any longer, and they seemed to forget
what it had been. All the miracles stopped,
and the sick king and the knights waited and
waited for one who was pure enough to show
them the perfect pattern again.</p>

<p>And one day a youth passed by who was
so innocent that he did not know what wrong
was. When the knights beheld him they
looked in wonder, and said: "Is it not he, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
innocent one, who will save us?" and they led
him up to the temple. And behold, it was the
time of the holy feast, when long ago the
light had passed above them. And the youth
stood there with great wonder and trouble in
his heart, for he saw the suffering of the king,
and how the knights longed and waited; he
heard their voices in solemn tones, and the
mourning voice of the king. And lo, while
he looked, a wonderful glowing light passed
above them. The knights all rose up with
great joy in their hearts and looked at the
boy, for the blessed miracle had come again,
and it was a sign.</p>

<p>But Parsifal stood still with wonder and
trouble in his heart; and when they asked if
he knew what his eyes had seen, he only
shook his head.</p>

<p>So the hope and joy went from the
knights, and they led him out and sent him
on his way.</p>

<p>And the boy Parsifal traveled down into
the world. And as he went he met many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
wrongs, and he began to know what evils
there were.</p>

<p>Now whenever one crossed his way, he
went to it and handled it. But behold his
mind was so pure and godlike that whenever
he touched evil to learn what it was, it grew
into some gentle thing in his hand. He went
throughout the whole world seeking to know
what evil was, but he was so mild and beautiful
that wrongs fell away before him, or were
healed as he passed. And he went on and on
to the very kingdom of Evil, at last, and
when its king saw him, he cried out with a
great cry, and hurled his spear; but it only
floated above the head of Parsifal, and when
he seized it in his hand the whole kingdom
melted away. And Parsifal found he was
standing in a sunny meadow not far from the
holy mountain; and he went up to the knights
and stood with them in the temple, and his
face was like the face of an angel. They say
the king was healed as he looked, and that the
wonderful light shone above them and was
with them always,&mdash;forever.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>

<p>Every evening after sunset, when the
most wonderful soft light is in the sky
and it is very still everywhere, the old bell in
the steeple chimes out over the village and
the fields around. No one quite knows what
the evening bell sings, but the tone is so beautiful
that everyone stands still and listens.</p>

<p>Ever since the oldest grandfather can remember,
the dear bell has sung at evening and
everyone has listened, and listened, for the
message.</p>

<p>A great many people said there was really
no message at all, and one very learned man
wrote a whole book to show that the song of
the evening bell was nothing but the clanging
of brass and iron; and almost everyone who
read it believed it. But there were many who
were not wise enough to read, so they lis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>tened
to the sweet tone just as lovingly as
they had listened when they were little children.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the sweet song pealed
out, the old shoemaker would forget and leave
his thread half drawn, and while he listened a
wonderful smiling light shone in his face.
But whenever the little grandson asked him
what the bell said to him, the old man only
shook his head and pulled the stitch through
and sewed on and on, until there was not any
more light; and for this reason the little boy
began to think that the bell was singing something
about work. He thought of it very often
when he sat on his grandfather's step listening
to the song and watching the people.
Sometimes those who had read the learned
book spoke together and laughed quite loudly,
to show that they were not paying any attention
to the bell; and there were others who
seemed not to hear it at all. But there were
some who listened just as the old grandfather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
had listened, and many who stopped and
bowed their heads and stood quite still for a
long, long while. But the strangest was, that
no one ever could tell the other what the bell
had sung to him. It was really a very deep
mystery.</p>

<p>Now there was a painter who had such
loving eyes that even when he looked on
homely, lowly things, he saw wonder that no
one else could see. He loved all the sweet
mysteries that are in the world, and he loved
the bell's song; he wondered about it just as
the little boy had done.</p>

<p>One evening, I think, he went alone beyond
the village and through the wide brown
fields; he saw the light in the sky, and the
birds going home, and the steeple far off. It
was all very still and wonderful, and as he
looked away on every side, thinking many
holy thoughts, he saw a man and a woman
working together in the dim light. They were
digging potatoes; there was a wheelbarrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
beside them, and a basket. Sometimes they
moved about slowly, or stooped with their
hands in the brown earth. And while they
worked, the sound of the evening bell came
faintly to them. When they heard it they
rose up. The mother folded her hands on
her breast and said the words of a prayer,
and thought of her little ones. The father
just held his hat in his hand and looked down
at their work. And the painter forgot all
the wonder of the sky and the wide field as
he looked at them, for there was a deeper
mystery. And it was plain to him.</p>

<p>But the man and the woman stood there
listening; they did not know that the bell was
singing to them of their very own work, of
every loving service and lowly task of the day.</p>

<p>The bell sang on and on, and the peace
of the song seemed to fill the whole day.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space">FRIEDRICH AND HIS CHILD-GARDEN.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span></p>

<p>Friedrich Froebel&mdash;"Little Friedrich,"
they called him long ago. Is it
not strange to think that the great men
who bring the beautiful deeds to the world
were once little children? Do you know how
these children grow so great and strong that
they can do a loving deed for the whole world
at last? They do little loving deeds every
day.</p>

<p>This gentle Friedrich loved more and
more things every day that he lived. But
when he was a little boy he was very lonely
sometimes, because he had no playmates except
the flowers in the old garden. It seemed
to him these flowers were always playing
plays together. The little pink and white
ones on the border of the beds seemed always
circling round the sweet tall rose, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
laughing and swaying in the wind. It was so
gay sometimes that he laughed aloud to see
them all nodding and bowing, and the rose
bowing too.</p>

<p>Friedrich was so gentle that his doves
would flutter around his head and settle on
his outstretched arms, and even the little
mother bird, with her nest in the hedge,
would let him stand near when she told little
stories to her babies. Friedrich had no dear
mother, but he had a tall, strong brother who
would sometimes take him to the sweet wide
meadows and tell him beautiful stories about
the strange little bugs and busy bees, and
stones and flowers.</p>

<p>But after awhile Friedrich's father
thought he was growing too old to play all
day long. So he said to him one day, "Friedrich,
you must begin to learn." When Friedrich
heard this he was glad, because he
wanted to know about all the wonderful
things in the world. But when he had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
sit still for long hours and learn out of large
books that hadn't a single picture, it was very
hard. "But there is no other way, little
Friedrich," his teachers told him.</p>

<p>As the time went on he grew as tall and
strong as his brother. And then what do you
think happened? Just the same thing that
happened to our America when George
Washington led out all the brave men.
Friedrich's dear Germany was in great
trouble, and she called to all her brave men
to come and save her. And Friedrich
marched away with all the others&mdash;marching,
marching, with the drums beating and the
flags flying.</p>

<p>Then after a long while, when peace had
come back and all was quiet and joyful again,
there came to Friedrich a sweet thought that
grew and grew. Can you think what it was?
It was half about his old garden and the playing
flowers, and half about little children.
Whenever he saw a child tear a flower or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
stone a bird he felt sad, and this thought
would grow stronger in his heart.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would gather up all the
children and take them to the meadow, and
teach them about the leaves and stones, the
flowers and birds and ants, as his brother
used to teach him, and then they would play
the very plays the wind and flowers and birds
had played. So he called it his kindergarten,&mdash;his
child-garden,&mdash;and he began to
show to the whole world that little children
must learn and grow in the same sweet way
that flowers do.</p>

<p>And he worked years and years, teaching
and working out this wonderful message that
had come to him. He loved God and children
and this shining thought better than
himself, and he wore poor clothes and gave
up things, that the beautiful deed might live
in the world.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span></p>

<p>In the far-off places of the world where men
do not pass often, it is nothing to be poor.
Little Hansei and his mother were poor, but
that was nothing to him. They lived on the
side of a great hill, where, save their small
black hut with its little gauzy curl of smoke,
there was no sign of life as far as eye could
reach. And it seemed to Hansei that the
whole world was theirs, and they were the
whole world. Yet on fair days, far below, the
misty towers and steeples of a city showed.
But this was as unreal and unreachable as
dreams and clouds to Hansei; the only difference
was, a yellow road wound down to it, and
if one went far enough he might some day
reach that strange, misty place. But dreams&mdash;they
always went at morning; and clouds&mdash;if
he climbed to the highest point of the hill
he could never reach them!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>Sometimes people had passed that way.
Once a man had gone bearing a burden. Another
time, as Hansei and his mother gathered
up their fagots at evening, a man and woman
passed together; the sunset light was on the
woman, and she sang as she went. Again,
men in dark robes and hoods passed by; some
had ridden on mules, some were grave and
walked, reading from small books, others
laughed. And these were all (except a peddler
who had lost his way) that Hansei had
ever seen go by.</p>

<p>People seldom went that way; the road
was steep, and there was an easier way down
at the other side, his mother said.</p>

<p>Once Hansei asked her if those who had
passed were all the people there were besides
themselves. His mother said, "There are
others off there," pointing to the city.</p>

<p>Every morning before it was light Hansei's
mother went away to the other side of
the hills somewhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>The first time he awoke and found the
black loaf and water waiting and his mother
gone, he had cried and searched and called
her over and over. "Mother! Mother!" he
had cried as loud as he could call down the
yellow road.</p>

<p>"Mother! Mother!" had come a strange
voice from beyond the hills; and Hansei's
heart had leaped with a new joy. He cried
back wildly, "Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Where are you?" cried the voice again.</p>

<p>"I am here!"</p>

<p>"I am here!"</p>

<p>"Come to me!"</p>

<p>"Come to me!"</p>

<p>All day Hansei and the strange voice from
beyond the hills called and cried to each other.
Hansei thought: "It is true there are others
off there, and some one is calling to me."</p>

<p>At night the mother came back. Hansei
asked: "Where have you been?" and put up
his arms. His mother said: "At the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
side of the hill," and touched his head gently.</p>

<p>"What did you do so long?"</p>

<p>"I made lace."</p>

<p>"What is lace?"</p>

<p>"It is like that a little," and she pointed
to a cobweb stretching from a dead twig to
a weed. Hansei looked and slowly put his
foot through it.</p>

<p>"Must you go tomorrow and next day?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Next day and always," said the mother,
looking off down the yellow road.</p>

<p>Hansei cried: "Let me go too; let me
go!"</p>

<p>"Hush, no; it is dark where I go."</p>

<p>"Is there no sun at the other side of the
hill?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; but we who make lace sit in
darkness."</p>

<p>Hansei asked: "Why must there be lace?"</p>

<p>The mother stared into the dusk. "Because,"
she said slowly, "there are princesses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
and great ladies down there who must be
beautiful."</p>

<p>"What is beautiful?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Always through the dusky summer evenings
they sat together on the doorstep, the
mother with her bent head resting on her
hand, and Hansei staring up at the great sky
and clouds and stars above him. Sometimes
the mother told strange stories, but oftener
they sat silent.</p>

<p>When winter came it seemed to Hansei
that half of all the joy and light and life went
out of the world. There were no birds nor
bugs nor bees left; the flowers were gone, and
the days were short and gray. It was cold,
and he could only stay in the dim little house,
playing with small sticks and stones, or tracing
the frostwork on the one little window. Frost
was like lace, his mother had told him.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, he would try to sing as the
woman had sung who passed that summer time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>One evening in the middle of winter Hansei
and his mother started out to a bit of
woods skirting the other side of the yellow
road. Hansei sang as they went; it was half
what the woman had sung and half like nothing
that was ever heard. Sometimes this tune
made his mother smile a little, but oftener she
did not hear it.</p>

<p>As they crossed the yellow road his mother
stopped and looked, as she always did.</p>

<p>"Hark!" she said, hushing the singing
with her hand. Hansei stood still and listened.
Yes, yes, they were coming&mdash;"the others." It
sounded again as it had the day the men had
ridden by, only more&mdash;more; and they were
coming nearer. There were voices and the
beat of footsteps, and sometimes Hansei heard
a strange sound that might be singing or wind
moaning.</p>

<p>Hansei said: "I am so afraid." But his
mother did not hear him. He hid his face in
her gown and waited. They were coming on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
and on; and they were saying something together,&mdash;strange
words that Hansei had never
heard. Nearer and nearer! He felt them
passing close where he and his mother stood;
he raised his head and looked.</p>

<p>He saw a long dark line of men, some
riding and some walking. Their heads were
bent, and they said the strange words together.
Sometimes there was a burst like song, then
the words again. There was one torch.</p>

<p>Slowly they made their way down the yellow
road. Hansei and his mother watched
them as they went.</p>

<p>He whispered, "Where are they going?"</p>

<p>"Down there," said the mother softly.
"It is the Christ-child's night."</p>

<p>"Why do they go?"</p>

<p>"To pray."</p>

<p>"What will they ask?"</p>

<p>"Light! light!"</p>

<p>"Can all go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>"Let us go, Mother; let us go! There is
a voice down there that calls me often."</p>

<p>The mother looked back at the little dark
house, then down the road where the one
point of light moved on.</p>

<p>"Come, let us go; let us follow it," she
said, taking his hand and hurrying down the
steep way in the darkness.</p>

<p>Through the long, wild night they toiled
on and on. Always the little light went before,
and always Hansei and his mother followed
where it led.</p>

<p>Once Hansei cried out: "See, Mother, the
torch is the star, and we are the shepherds
seeking the little Christ-child!" And he
laughed.</p>

<p>In the gray dawn they came to the misty
city. "How strange! how strange!" thought
Hansei, as they went down the narrow streets.
"How many houses, and lights, and people!
But the real light, the little star, we must not
lose it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>Just before them went the dark line of
men and the torch. People who met them
stepped aside and always made strange signs
on their breasts. Suddenly the light went out,
and the men disappeared into what seemed a
great shadow.</p>

<p>Hansei asked: "What is it?"</p>

<p>His mother said: "A church."</p>

<p>"Let us go in, too; the star went;" and
Hansei, with all his strength, pushed back the
great door.</p>

<p>"People! people!" little Hansei had not
dreamed there were so many of "the others."
There in the dim light they were kneeling,
praying for "light, light," his mother had told
him.</p>

<p>Far beyond there were small lights, like
stars shining, and a man in a white robe, who
said the strange words he had heard on the
yellow road. Then the kneeling people all
said something together. Hansei thought,
"They are trying to tell him they want the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
light, and he does not understand." Hansei's
mother knelt where she stood, and he crept
down beside her. He heard her saying the
words he did not know. He only said softly:
"Light, light for them all!"</p>

<p>An old woman knelt near him; not far
off a lame boy and a mother with a sleeping
child in her arms knelt also, and there beyond,
a woman. Ah, he knew what "beautiful" was
now! He looked to see if she wore lace like
cobwebs and frost. She did not pray; she only
knelt there. Tears were in her eyes. "Light
for her and all," whispered Hansei over and
over.</p>

<p>Then it was as if a dream came true.
Some one that had stood near stepped back,
and there, there beyond, appeared the little
Christ-child, just as his mother had told him.
There was the beautiful mother, the wise men
and angels, the youth, the maiden, and the
light shining from the child and touching them
all, all, even the poor little beasts off there!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>Hansei cried: "Look, look, Mother! the
Christ-child!"</p>

<p>His mother said, "Hush-hsh! It is not
the real Christ-child, but a picture."</p>

<p>Hansei looked back. "Not the real Christ-child?
But, Mother, the star stopped here!
Then the real Christ-child is here somewhere,
I know."</p>

<p>He looked about, but he saw only the old
woman, the lame boy, the mother with her
child, and the beautiful woman who could not
pray. He turned back to the painted child
and the light, and looked, and looked; he
stared his eyes blind; at last he could not see;
all seemed to fade, to go. The tired eyelids
fell; his head drooped down on his mother's
arm, and he slept.</p>

<p>But his eyes still held the light, and he
dreamed.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the beautiful pictured
light grew and broadened into a great
shining. "Surely," thought the little boy, "the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
real Christ-child is near! but where? not here;
here is only the old woman and the lame boy
and the others praying. But the great light&mdash;shining
over all, above every head, in shining
rings! how beautiful!"</p>

<p>And he thought he cried out, "See, you
have the light, all of you! Do not pray, but
be glad!" They did not hear, and prayed on.</p>

<p>"But the Christ-child&mdash;where is the real
Christ-child?" he wondered. He thought he
stood up and strained his eyes over the bent
heads of the praying people, and while he
looked he saw myriad circles of light begin
to glow; and lo! there, near&mdash;so near&mdash;was
the real Christ-child,&mdash;only it was the old
woman. Dreams are strange!</p>

<p>Her bent, trembling body seemed going,
fading, and there knelt a shining being,&mdash;the
real Christ-child; yet it was the old woman.
And the lame boy, the hurt creature, as he
looked, melted into the shadow of his radiant,
perfect self, and shined too. The mother with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
her child grew bright, bright; and each of the
kneeling, praying ones was a perfect shining
child! The light grew into glory; the fullness
of joy broke into singing; angels, heavenly
hosts, singing, "The Christ is here,&mdash;here in
the world!"</p>

<p>But what&mdash;? Who&mdash;? Why, his mother,
to be sure, leaning above him.</p>

<p>"Wake, Hansei; hear the music! See the
choir boys in white, like angels."</p>

<p>Hansei opened his eyes wide. The glorious
Christmas morning was beaming full
upon him through the great window, and he
saw the light of the new day touching the bent
old woman, the lame boy, the mother with her
child, the beautiful woman beyond, and the
pictured Christ.</p>

<p>He heard clear voices, "Peace on earth!"</p>

<p>But the dream&mdash;the dream!</p>

<p>"I have found the real Christ-child," he
whispered.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space">SAUL AND DAVID.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span></p>

<p>The great King Saul of Israel was sad,
and the sorrow grew and grew until it
spread abroad through the whole nation.
Even it came to the simple folk who minded
sheep and lived in the far hills.</p>

<p>"The mighty king is sad," said one who
had come from a journey. And the people
gathered about him and marveled that a king
should sorrow.</p>

<p>"The king is sad," said the one. "He has
traveled into the great desert, where nothing
blooms and there are no rivers."</p>

<p>The people stood still and looked off over
their stretching pastures, and heard the gush
of water brooks.</p>

<p>"He sits alone in a dim tent, with his
head in his hands," said the one. "His sword
rests at his feet. The army goes no more to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
battle. The servants weep and pray, and
strain their eyes over the burning sand, waiting."</p>

<p>"Waiting?" said the men.</p>

<p>"For one to come," said the other.</p>

<p>"Who shall come?" they asked together.</p>

<p>"The joy-bringer," said the man.</p>

<p>The shepherds looked at one another,
and then away; and when they had stood
awhile in silence, they moved off after their
sheep.</p>

<p>The boy David went swiftly. His feet
pressed springing grass, he smelt the odor of
new-turned earth, and the sound of water was
in his ears. He could not think that there
were really deserts. But he thought of the
sad, lonely king, and wished that he might go
to him. He came to where his sheep were
feeding, and stood among them and heard
their bleating; but he did not think of them.
He was looking into the wide sky, and wondering
if God would not send his angel to
save the king; but there was no sign save the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
peace and wonder that had always shone
there. He turned and led his flock to the
fold, and when he had done so he sat down
on the hillside and played upon his harp; and
the music was as beautiful as silence, so that
shy creatures did not fear, but crept around
to listen. The pale moon rose up, and the
stars shone down like loving, glistening eyes.</p>

<p>Sometimes there had come to David
strange longings for far-off things, and he too
had grown sad like the king. But then would
he take his harp to the hill and sing of the
sweet promise of the perfect gift that was to
come from God to the world,&mdash;to shepherds
and kings and all. And when he had sung so,
behold! the peace was again in his heart, and
he wished no longer to go seeking, for he
knew the gift would surely come.</p>

<p>He thought of the king as he sang. "He
has forgot the promise; I must go to him and
sing," he said.</p>

<p>So he rose up in the night, and woke his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
brother to give him charge over his flock.
And when he had plucked long-stemmed, dripping
lilies to wind through his harp strings,
he went away by the same road all other travelers
had gone.</p>

<p>Day after day he journeyed, passing
through sweet fields and pastures. He saw
men sowing, and others tending their flocks;
and there were mothers with babes in their
arms and children about them. "The gift
will come to you, and you, and all," he
thought, as he passed.</p>

<p>He went through the wilderness, and even
through the dry desert; but his heart was singing
and the thought of the promise was there
like living water.</p>

<p>Now the king's servants saw him afar off,
and they ran out to meet him and knelt at his
feet; for when they saw the light on his shining
hair, and the harp with living lilies, they
thought, "It is God's angel!"</p>

<p>But he said to them, "I am only a loving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
boy; I am David, a shepherd, and I have
come to King Saul." He smiled into the wondering
faces, and passing among them he
came to where the king was, and stood in his
very presence; and he was not afraid. They
say a beautiful light shone from his face.</p>

<p>The tent was dim, and the weary king did
not stir.</p>

<p>The boy knelt down, and stripping off the
lilies, he tuned his harp and began to sing.
The poet tells how he played for the mighty
king; and what do you think it was? Just the
tune all his sheep knew; always it brought
them, one after one, to the pen door at evening.
It was so strange and sweet a tune that
quail on the corn lands would each leave its
mate to fly after the player; and crickets&mdash;it
made them so wild with delight they would
fight one another. Then he played what sets
the field mouse musing, and the cattle to
deeper dreaming in the sunny meadows.</p>

<p>He sang of green pastures and water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
brooks, and the morning joy of shepherds
bounding over wide pastures. The light
shines in streams, the hungry, happy sheep
break out, and the long golden day is to be
lived!</p>

<p>Then he sang of the peace that comes to
shepherds at evening, when the gentle sheep
and sleepy, bleating lambs go home across the
sweet wide meadow, and the stars come out
in the serene heavens. Then it is to the
shepherd as if nature and man and God are
all one, and love is all there is in the whole
world.</p>

<p>At last the boy David sang of the perfect
gift that will surely come; and he sang until
the evil sorrow itself grew into peace.</p>

<p>The king stirred and raised his head. It
was to him as if it had rained, and flowers
had sprung up in the desert.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>
